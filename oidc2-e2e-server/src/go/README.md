# Go API Server for swagger

This endpoint establishes an end-to-end encrypted client-server session after authenticating the client with its Id Certification Token (Client_ICT). After the successful exchange of DH parameters, the client can communicate with the server, upload, download or delete files on the server with all communication being encrypted on application layer.
